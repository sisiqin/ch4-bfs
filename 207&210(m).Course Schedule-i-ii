## 题

### 这是拓扑排序题

207要求返回true/false ， 210 要求返回一个accpetable的课程排序， 比如第一个例子需要返回  [0, 1] 

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?


```
example 1 :
2, [[1,0]]
```
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.


```
example 2: 
2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
```
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


## 思路

做拓扑排序题需要算**入度**：对于每一个点，有多少条边**指向我**。比如第一个例子：
```
0 -> 1
```
课程0的入度为0，没有边指向它；课程1的入度为1，0指向它。

所以这个题可以这么做 ：
